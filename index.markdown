# Web Systems

A collection or material and exercises for learning how to build web based systems using [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). A web based system, in my view, is one in which clients interact with a backend server using the HTTP protocol. Examples include Google's Gmail (client side portion is written in JavaScript and runs in a web browser), but also Twitter's [iPhone app](https://twitter.com/#!/download/iphone) (client side portion is written in Objective-C and runs on an iPhone), however this material focuses on clients that are developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Note that the exercises build on each other to some extent, so it makes some sense to work through this material in the following order.

1. JavaScript
* HTTP requests: [material](materials/requests.html), [exercise](exercises/bench.html)
* HTTP responses
* Web server basics
* HTML, the web's presentation layer
* HTML forms and POST HTTP requests
* HTTP and state (session management)
* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
* DOM model and API
* Client side programming with jQuery
* Asynchronous HTTP requests (using jQuery)

Here are some general references I find helpful:

* [JavaScript language guide and reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript) from Mozilla.
* CSS standard
* Node.js docs
